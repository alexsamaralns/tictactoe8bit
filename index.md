<h2>Classic game <strong>Tic Tac Toe</strong> 8bit version</h2>

<p>A casual game that we learned since we were children and still entertains us today.<br> 
Employing my knowledge of the Angular framework, I developed the classic game Tic Tac Toe<br>with a visual of the video game 8 bit of the 80's.<br>
Simple and basic animations that resemble retro games.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The game was developed for 2 players. Player 1 who starts with the first move uses the X symbol in red<br>
  and player 2 uses the circle symbol in yellow.</p>
