<h3><strong>Tic Tac Toe</strong> 8 bit Version</h4>
<h4>Classic game Tic Tac Toe</h4>

<p>A casual game that we learned since we were children and still entertains us today.<br>
  Employing my knowledge of the Angular framework, I developed the classic game Tic Tac Toe<br>
  with a visual of the video game 8 bit of the 80's. Simple and basic animations that resemble retro games.</p>
  
<h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>The game was developed for 2 players. Player 1 who starts with the first move<br>
  uses the X symbol in red and player 2 uses the circle symbol in yellow.</p>

<h3><strong>Rules</strong></h3>
<p>The rules are quite simple. The first one who manages to close a straight line with 3 consecutive symbols<br>
  horizontally, vertically or diagonally will be the winner and will be awarded 1 point.<br>
  If all the spaces are filled and none of the players manage to have their respective symbol<br>
  in sequence of 3 symbols horizontally, vertically or diagonally the game is finished and is given as a tie.</p>

<h3><strong>Points Panel</strong></h3>  
<p>The points panel identifies when it is the turn of each of the 2 players.<br>
  By default, player 1 is red and player 2 is yellow. Just below is the Reset Score button,<br>
  which has the function of resetting the score of the two players and restarting the game by clearing the symbols of all spaces.</p>
